A space for simple JS apps, which are mainly made for my personal use. 
## Sourdough calculator
A simple calculator for bakers percentages. It allows to calculate bread hydration and other characteristics from weights of ingredients, and also calculate ingredient weights from desired characteristics.
## JSON to TCX converter
Made after the server for Run4Gear burned down - The actual conversion code was written and posted by Run4Gear's creator, but the is app provides a more convenient way to do the conversion in browser, not in a command line. Note that it only meant to run with JSON files produced by Run4Gear.
